# About

Documenting user stories is an essential part of Agile software development, as it helps ensure that everyone involved in the project is on the same page.
This document follows classic format:
```
As a [type of user], I want to [perform some task] so that [I can achieve some goal].
```
## Client
* As a client, I want to be able to enter my phone number and receive an SMS authorization code so that I can easily access my locker without having to carry a physical barcode.
* As a client, I want to have the option to generate a barcode instead of using SMS authorization so that I can choose the method that is most convenient for me.
* As a client, I want to be able to opt-in to having my photo taken by the service so that I can provide an additional form of identification in case I lose my barcode or my phone.
* As a client, I want to be able to set up the duration of my locker rental and pay for it so that I can secure a locker for the amount of time I need.
* As a client, I want to be able to open my locker once within a 15-minute time frame after it was first closed, so that I can add or remove items from my locker before it is locked again.
* As a client, I want to be notified that my locker will be blocked after 30 minutes if I don't use my SMS authorization code or barcode to open it so that I can avoid additional fees.
* As a client who has lost my barcode, I want to be able to ask an admin for help so that I can still access my locker even if I don't have my barcode.
* As a client, I want the system to automatically move my luggage to a storage area if I don't claim my locker after 12 hours of pre-paid time so that I can avoid losing my luggage.
* As a client, I want to be charged separately for storage area fees so that I can understand the additional costs associated with not claiming my locker on time.
* As a client, I want to be able to choose from different levels of locker rentals with varying prices so that I can select the option that best fits my needs and budget.
* As a client, I want to be informed that if my luggage is not claimed after a week, it will be reported to the police so that I can take necessary actions to retrieve my luggage.

## Cleaner
* As a cleaner, I want to receive a notification when a locker is vacated so that I can clean and prepare it for the next user.

* As a technician, I want to be able to access a list of all lockers with physical locks that need maintenance so that I can plan my work efficiently.

* As a technician, I want to be able to report any issues with the physical lockers to the admin so that they can be addressed promptly.

# Admin

* As an admin, I want to be able to view a dashboard of key metrics, such as the number of lockers in use, the number of users, and any system errors so that I can understand the system's overall health.
* As an admin, I want to be able to report bugs and issues to the IT support team so that they can be addressed promptly.
* As an admin, I want to be able to configure system settings, such as the duration of locker rentals and the fees for storage, so that I can customize the system to meet our business needs.

# Officer
* As an officer, I want to receive notifications when luggage has not been claimed after 12 hours so that I can inspect it and determine the next course of action.
* As an officer, I want to be able to view a list of all unclaimed luggage, including the contents and any relevant details, so that I can prioritize my inspections.
* As an officer, I want to be able to update the status of unclaimed luggage in the system after I've inspected it so that the system reflects the current status.
